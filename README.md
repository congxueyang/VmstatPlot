VmstatPlot
==========

These are very simple scripts for collecting information about system
load during a load-test, to make it easy to visually identify
bottlenecks by staring at graphs.

At the moment this is a data collector script `sysstat` which collects
data from `vmstat`, `/proc/` and assorted log files.

The `vmplot.py` script makes it easy to visualize the collected data
using `gnuplot`.
